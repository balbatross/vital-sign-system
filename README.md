## Vital sign recording system

This is a proof of concept repo for recording vital signs. The current laws and regulations prevent Nurses and Doctors from recording vital signs on their own phones and they have not been provided with adequate resourcing to be able to manage this without hassle.

Together we could build better infrastructure for a better tomorrow.

Information is for everyone and the open source community is here to provide, all that is required is that people to ask.
